        "1. Find, or create, a pretrained model. This can be instruct-tuned, or not, the options are overwhelmingly endless here!\n",

        ">\n",
        "> 💻 **Optimization:** This is the most complex part. In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don't deviate too far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO.\n",
